The _**B**ioprospecting and **E**ngineering of **A**dvanced **M**icrobial **S**olutions_ (**BEAMS**) Laboratory is a research group run by <a href="/author/matin-nuhamunada/">Matin Nuhamunada</a> at the Faculty of Biology, UGM. Our group focus on exploring and bioprospecting biological systems for biotechnology applications. We implement genome mining approaches combined with modern data stacks to find interesting natural products, enzymes, and pathways.

We are always interested to find students with interdiscplinary skills to join our group! If you like biology, data, programming, or mathematics and would like to know more about our research, please drop by or send an email to [matin_nuhamunada@ugm.ac.id](mailto:matin_nuhamunada@ugm.ac.id).
