Termites are a diverse group of insects that play a crucial role in decomposing lignocellulosic material from dead plants, such as leaves and wood. Their ability to utilize cellulose, the most abundant organic matter on earth, contributes to their widespread ecological success. This capability is largely due to lignocellulolytic enzymes obtained through a symbiotic relationship with various microbes in the termite gut. The lignocellulose-rich diet of termites requires a symbiotic environment containing a diverse array of microbes that intricately interact to fulfill their ecological roles. This complex interaction likely involves many bioactive compounds with various roles in communication, host-signaling, and competition. Our study aims to extend the genomic information from our previous collection of isolated termite gut bacteria by sequencing and analyzing their genomes to uncover novel genetic elements and pathways involved in lignocellulolytic activity and bioactive compound production. This information can be combined with existing datasets to search for novel enzymes and bioactives with applications in biotechnology and medicine.
