abstract: 'This study showcases 121 new genomes of spore-forming Bacillales from strains collected globally from a variety of habitats, assembled using Oxford Nanopore long-read and MGI short-read sequences.Bacilliare renowned for their capacity to produce diverse secondary metabolites with use in agriculture, biotechnology, and medicine. These secondary metabolites are encoded within biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGCs). smBGCs have significant research interest due to their potential for the discovery of new bioactivate compounds. Our dataset includes 62 complete genomes, 2 at chromosome level, and 57 at contig level, covering a genomic size range from 3.50 Mb to 7.15 Mb. Phylotaxonomic analysis revealed that these genomes span 16 genera, with 69 of them belonging toBacillus. A total of 1,176 predicted BGCs were identified byin silicogenome mining. We anticipate that the open-access data presented here will expand the reported genomic information of spore-formingBacillalesand facilitate a deeper understanding of the genetic basis ofBacillalesâ€™ potential for secondary metabolite production.'
