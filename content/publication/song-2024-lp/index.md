abstract: AbstractThis study showcases 121 new genomes of spore-formingBacillalesfrom
  strains collected globally from a variety of habitats, assembled using Oxford Nanopore
  long-read and MGI short-read sequences.Bacilliare renowned for their capacity to
  produce diverse secondary metabolites with use in agriculture, biotechnology, and
  medicine. These secondary metabolites are encoded within biosynthetic gene clusters
  (smBGCs). smBGCs have significant research interest due to their potential for the
  discovery of new bioactivate compounds. Our dataset includes 62 complete genomes,
  2 at chromosome level, and 57 at contig level, covering a genomic size range from
  3.50 Mb to 7.15 Mb. Phylotaxonomic analysis revealed that these genomes span 16
  genera, with 69 of them belonging toBacillus. A total of 1,176 predicted BGCs were
  identified byin silicogenome mining. We anticipate that the open-access data presented
  here will expand the reported genomic information of spore-formingBacillalesand
  facilitate a deeper understanding of the genetic basis ofBacillales’ potential for
  secondary metabolite production.
