 abstract = {AbstractThis study showcases 121 new genomes of
spore-formingBacillalesfrom strains collected globally from a
variety of habitats, assembled using Oxford Nanopore long-read and
MGI short-read sequences.Bacilliare renowned for their capacity to
produce diverse secondary metabolites with use in agriculture,
biotechnology, and medicine. These secondary metabolites are
encoded within biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGCs). smBGCs have
significant research interest due to their potential for the
discovery of new bioactivate compounds. Our dataset includes 62
complete genomes, 2 at chromosome level, and 57 at contig level,
covering a genomic size range from 3.50 Mb to 7.15 Mb.
Phylotaxonomic analysis revealed that these genomes span 16
genera, with 69 of them belonging toBacillus. A total of 1,176
predicted BGCs were identified byin silicogenome mining. We
anticipate that the open-access data presented here will expand
the reported genomic information of spore-formingBacillalesand
facilitate a deeper understanding of the genetic basis
ofBacillales’ potential for secondary metabolite production.},
