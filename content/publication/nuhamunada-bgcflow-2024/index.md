abstract: 'Genome mining is revolutionizing natural products discovery  efforts. The rapid increase in available genomes demands  comprehensive computational platforms to effectively extract  biosynthetic knowledge encoded across bacterial pangenomes. Here,  we present BGCFlow, a novel systematic workflow integrating  analytics for large-scale genome mining of bacterial pangenomes.  BGCFlow incorporates several genome analytics and mining tools  grouped into five common stages of analysis such as: (i) data  selection, (ii) functional annotation, (iii) phylogenetic  analysis, (iv) genome mining, and (v) comparative analysis.  Furthermore, BGCFlow provides easy configuration of different  projects, parallel distribution, scheduled job monitoring, an  interactive database to visualize tables, exploratory Jupyter  Notebooks, and customized reports. Here, we demonstrate the  application of BGCFlow by investigating the phylogenetic  distribution of various biosynthetic gene clusters detected  across 42 genomes of the Saccharopolyspora genus, known to  produce industrially important secondary/specialized metabolites.  The BGCFlow-guided analysis predicted more accurate dereplication  of BGCs and guided the targeted comparative analysis of selected  RiPPs. The scalable, interoperable, adaptable, re-entrant, and  reproducible nature of the BGCFlow will provide an effective  novel way to extract the biosynthetic knowledge from the  ever-growing genomic datasets of biotechnologically relevant  bacterial species.'
