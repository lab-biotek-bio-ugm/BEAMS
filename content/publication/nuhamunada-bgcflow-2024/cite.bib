               efforts. The rapid increase in available genomes demands
               comprehensive computational platforms to effectively extract
               biosynthetic knowledge encoded across bacterial pangenomes. Here,
               we present BGCFlow, a novel systematic workflow integrating
               analytics for large-scale genome mining of bacterial pangenomes.
               BGCFlow incorporates several genome analytics and mining tools
               grouped into five common stages of analysis such as: (i) data
               selection, (ii) functional annotation, (iii) phylogenetic
               analysis, (iv) genome mining, and (v) comparative analysis.
               Furthermore, BGCFlow provides easy configuration of different
               projects, parallel distribution, scheduled job monitoring, an
               interactive database to visualize tables, exploratory Jupyter
               Notebooks, and customized reports. Here, we demonstrate the
               application of BGCFlow by investigating the phylogenetic
               distribution of various biosynthetic gene clusters detected
               across 42 genomes of the Saccharopolyspora genus, known to
               produce industrially important secondary/specialized metabolites.
               The BGCFlow-guided analysis predicted more accurate dereplication
               of BGCs and guided the targeted comparative analysis of selected
               RiPPs. The scalable, interoperable, adaptable, re-entrant, and
               reproducible nature of the BGCFlow will provide an effective
               novel way to extract the biosynthetic knowledge from the
               ever-growing genomic datasets of biotechnologically relevant
               bacterial species.",
