 abstract = {Microorganisms produce a wide variety of secondary/specialized
metabolites (SMs), the majority of which are yet to be
discovered. These natural products play multiple roles in
microbiomes and are important for microbial competition,
communication, and success in the environment. SMs have been our
major source of antibiotics and are used in a range of
biotechnological applications. In silico mining for biosynthetic
gene clusters (BGCs) encoding the production of SMs is commonly
used to assess the genetic potential of organisms. However, as
BGCs span tens to over 200 kb, identifying complete BGCs requires
genome data that has minimal assembly gaps within the BGCs, a
prerequisite that was previously only met by individually
sequenced genomes. Here, we assess the performance of the
currently available genome mining platform antiSMASH on 1,080
high-quality metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes (HQ MAGs)
previously produced from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)
using a combination of long-read (Oxford Nanopore) and short-read
(Illumina) sequencing technologies. More than 4,200 different
BGCs were identified, with 88% of these being complete. Sequence
similarity clustering of the BGCs implies that the majority of
this biosynthetic potential likely encodes novel compounds, and
few BGCs are shared between genera. We identify BGCs in abundant
and functionally relevant genera in WWTPs, suggesting a role of
secondary metabolism in this ecosystem. We find that the assembly
of HQ MAGs using long-read sequencing is vital to explore the
genetic potential for SM production among the uncultured members
of microbial communities. IMPORTANCE Cataloguing secondary
metabolite (SM) potential using genome mining of metagenomic data
has become the method of choice in bioprospecting for novel
compounds. However, accurate biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC)
detection requires unfragmented genomic assemblies, which have
been technically difficult to obtain from metagenomes until very
recently with new long-read technologies. Here, we determined the
biosynthetic potential of activated sludge (AS), the microbial
community used in resource recovery and wastewater treatment, by
mining high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes generated from
long-read data. We found over 4,000 BGCs, including BGCs in
abundant process-critical bacteria, with no similarity to the
BGCs of characterized products. We show how long-read MAGs are
required to confidently assemble complete BGCs, and we determined
that the AS BGCs from different studies have very little overlap,
suggesting that AS is a rich source of biosynthetic potential and
new bioactive compounds.},
