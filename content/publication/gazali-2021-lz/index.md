abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Monitoring the spread of the G614 in specific locations is
  critical as this variant is highly transmissible and can trigger the emergence of
  other mutations. Therefore, a rapid and accurate method that can reliably detect
  the D614G mutation will be beneficial. This study aims to analyze the potential
  use of the two-step Reverse Transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction
  - high resolution melting analysis (RT-qPCR-HRM) to detect a specific mutation in
  the SARS-CoV-2 genome. METHODS: Six SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples were synthesized into
  cDNA and analyzed with the qPCR-HRM method in order to detect the D614G mutation
  in Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The primers are designed to target the specific
  Spike region containing the D614G mutation. The qPCR-HRM analysis was conducted
  simultaneously, and the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 variant was confirmed by
  conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing methods. RESULTS: The results showed that
  the melting temperature (Tm) of the D614 variant was 79.39 ± 0.03 °C, which was
  slightly lower than the Tm of the G614 variant (79.62 ± 0.015 °C). The results of
  the HRM analysis, visualized by the normalized melting curve and the difference
  curve were able to discriminate the D614 and G614 variant samples. All samples were
  identified as G614 variants by qPCR-HRM assay, which was subsequently confirmed
  by Sanger sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a sensitive method that
  can identify the D614G mutation by a simple two-step RT-qPCR-HRM assay procedure
  analysis, which can be useful for active surveillance of the transmission of a specific
  mutation.'
