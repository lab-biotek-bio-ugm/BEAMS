               efforts. The rapid increase in available genomes demands
               comprehensive computational platforms to effectively extract
               biosynthetic knowledge encoded across bacterial pangenomes. Here,
               we present BGCFlow, a novel systematic workflow integrating
               analytics for large-scale genome mining of bacterial pangenomes.
               BGCFlow incorporates several genome analytics and mining tools
               grouped into five common stages of analysis such as: (i) data
               selection, (ii) functional annotation, (iii) phylogenetic
               analysis, (iv) genome mining, and (v) comparative analysis.
               Furthermore, BGCFlow provides easy configuration of different
               projects, parallel distribution, scheduled job monitoring, an
               interactive database to visualize tables, exploratory Jupyter
               Notebooks, and customized reports. Here, we demonstrate the
               application of BGCFlow by investigating the phylogenetic
               distribution of various biosynthetic gene clusters detected
               across 42 genomes of the Saccharopolyspora genus, known to
               produce industrially important secondary/specialized metabolites.
               The BGCFlow-guided analysis predicted more accurate dereplication
               of BGCs and guided the targeted comparative analysis of selected
               RiPPs. The scalable, interoperable, adaptable, re-entrant, and
               reproducible nature of the BGCFlow will provide an effective
               novel way to extract the biosynthetic knowledge from the
               ever-growing genomic datasets of biotechnologically relevant
               bacterial species.",

              untargeted metabolomics that combines algorithms for data
              pre-processing, spectral matching, molecular formula and
              structural predictions, and an integration to the GNPS workflows
              Feature-Based Molecular Networking and Ion Identity Molecular
              Networking for downstream analysis. UmetaFlow is implemented as a

              reproducible. For more interactive computing, visualization, as
              well as development, the workflow is also implemented in Jupyter
              notebooks using the Python programming language and a set of
              Python bindings to the OpenMS algorithms (pyOpenMS). Finally,
              UmetaFlow is also offered as a web-based Graphical User Interface
              for parameter optimization and processing of smaller-sized
              datasets. UmetaFlow was validated with in-house LC-MS/MS datasets
              of actinomycetes producing known secondary metabolites, as well as
              commercial standards, and it detected all expected features and
              accurately annotated 76\% of the molecular formulas and 65\% of
              the structures. As a more generic validation, the publicly
              available MTBLS733 and MTBLS736 datasets were used for
              benchmarking, and UmetaFlow detected more than 90\% of all ground
              truth features and performed exceptionally well in quantification
              and discriminating marker selection. We anticipate that UmetaFlow
              will provide a useful platform for the interpretation of large
              metabolomics datasets.",

               metabolites (SMs), the majority of which are yet to be
               discovered. These natural products play multiple roles in
               microbiomes and are important for microbial competition,
               communication, and success in the environment. SMs have been our
               major source of antibiotics and are used in a range of
               biotechnological applications. In silico mining for biosynthetic
               gene clusters (BGCs) encoding the production of SMs is commonly
               used to assess the genetic potential of organisms. However, as
               BGCs span tens to over 200 kb, identifying complete BGCs requires
               genome data that has minimal assembly gaps within the BGCs, a
               prerequisite that was previously only met by individually
               sequenced genomes. Here, we assess the performance of the
               currently available genome mining platform antiSMASH on 1,080
               high-quality metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes (HQ MAGs)
               previously produced from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)
               using a combination of long-read (Oxford Nanopore) and short-read
               (Illumina) sequencing technologies. More than 4,200 different
               BGCs were identified, with 88\% of these being complete. Sequence
               similarity clustering of the BGCs implies that the majority of
               this biosynthetic potential likely encodes novel compounds, and
               few BGCs are shared between genera. We identify BGCs in abundant
               and functionally relevant genera in WWTPs, suggesting a role of
               secondary metabolism in this ecosystem. We find that the assembly
               of HQ MAGs using long-read sequencing is vital to explore the
               genetic potential for SM production among the uncultured members
               of microbial communities. IMPORTANCE Cataloguing secondary
               metabolite (SM) potential using genome mining of metagenomic data
               has become the method of choice in bioprospecting for novel
               compounds. However, accurate biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC)
               detection requires unfragmented genomic assemblies, which have
               been technically difficult to obtain from metagenomes until very
               recently with new long-read technologies. Here, we determined the
               biosynthetic potential of activated sludge (AS), the microbial
               community used in resource recovery and wastewater treatment, by
               mining high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes generated from
               long-read data. We found over 4,000 BGCs, including BGCs in
               abundant process-critical bacteria, with no similarity to the
               BGCs of characterized products. We show how long-read MAGs are
               required to confidently assemble complete BGCs, and we determined
               that the AS BGCs from different studies have very little overlap,
               suggesting that AS is a rich source of biosynthetic potential and
               new bioactive compounds.",
